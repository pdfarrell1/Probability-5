# Probability Problem: Events A and B

This project is a **self-contained HTML page** that visually and step-by-step explains a probability problem involving two events, **A** and **B**.  
It is designed as an **educational resource** for students learning probability, featuring calculations, a Venn diagram, and a probability table summary.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The project consists of a single file:

- `index.html` – contains all the HTML and CSS required to display the probability problem, solution steps, diagram, and tables.

No external JavaScript, CSS, or library dependencies are required. Everything is built-in and runs in the browser.

---

## 🎯 Features

- **Styled Interface**  
  Clean and modern layout with gradient backgrounds, cards, and subtle shadows for readability.

- **Step-by-Step Solutions**  
  Each probability calculation is broken into clear steps, with formulas, calculations, and final results.

- **Venn Diagram (SVG)**  
  A simple custom SVG diagram visualizes the probability regions:  
  - `A ∩ B`  
  - `A ∩ B'`  
  - `A' ∩ B`  
  - `A' ∩ B'`

- **Probability Table Summary**  
  A 2x2 table showing joint, marginal, and total probabilities, verifying all values add up to 1.

- **Verification Section**  
  Double-checks the marginal and complement probabilities for consistency.

## 📝 Problem Statement

We are given:

- `Pr[A] = 0.45`  
- `Pr[B] = 0.55`  
- `Pr[A' ∩ B] = 0.40`

From this, the program calculates:

1. `Pr[A ∩ B]`  
2. `Pr[B' ∩ A]`  
3. `Pr[A' ∩ B']`

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download or copy the `index.html` file.
2. Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Scroll through the interactive explanation to follow the solution process.

No server or extra setup is required.

---

## 📊 Final Results

- `Pr[A ∩ B] = 0.15`  
- `Pr[B' ∩ A] = 0.30`  
- `Pr[A' ∩ B'] = 0.15`

All four disjoint regions sum to 1.0, verifying correctness.
